# Badger Sett

> A *sett* or set is a badger's den which usually consists of a network of tunnels
  and numerous entrances. Setts incorporate larger chambers used for sleeping or
  rearing young.

This script is designed to raise young Privacy Badgers by teaching them a little
about the trackers on popular sites, thus preparing them to fight trackers out
in the wild. `crawler.py` visits the top 1,000 sites of the Majestic Million
with a fresh version of Privacy Badger installed and saves the `action_map` and
`snitch_map` it learns in `results.json`.
